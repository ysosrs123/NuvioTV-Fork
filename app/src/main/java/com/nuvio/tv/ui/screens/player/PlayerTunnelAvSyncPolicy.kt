// Tunnelled video releases frames against the platform's hw_av_sync audio clock. When the
// HAL never starts that clock the player sits in STATE_READY with data buffered and no
// media3 or app watchdog fires. Two oracles, because HALs fail differently:
//  - position progress: on Amlogic the codec reports frames rendered even while the tunnel
//    renderer holds them, so a frozen position is the only signal (seen for app-packed
//    IEC 61937 and for PCM under tunnelling);
//  - rendered-frame count: on MediaTek (Fire TV) the counter stays at zero while the picture
//    is held, and is the earlier signal.
// Either disarms tunnelling for the stream. Only a frozen position marks the audio class as
// dead-clocked: a held picture with an advancing position is not an audio-clock fault.
