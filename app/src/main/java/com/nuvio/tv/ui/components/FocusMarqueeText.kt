// Compose's default marquee velocity (MarqueeDefaults.Velocity) is 30.dp/s, which at our title font
// is only ~3.5 characters/second. Screen-reading research on horizontally scrolling text shows
// comprehension stays high (~95%) up to ~8.5 chars/second (~85 wpm), so 45.dp/s (~5.3 cps) reads
// noticeably faster while keeping a comfortable margin below that rate.

// A marquee is an animation: it wakes the Compose frame clock ~50 times a second for as long as it
// runs, and on a TV the focus can rest on the same row or card for hours. Unbounded
// (Int.MAX_VALUE) that cost never ends -- a Settings sidebar left on "Content & Discovery" measured
// 1460 frames and 271 CPU ticks over 30s on a Fire TV Cube, and would have gone on doing that all
// night. Three passes is enough to read a long label, and matches what the platform has always
// defaulted to for TextView (android:marqueeRepeatLimit="3"); after that the text rests and the
// screen goes quiet. Moving focus away and back replays it, because the modifier only exists while
// the item is focused.
