/**
 * Regression tests for currently-airing series leaving Continue Watching on air day.
 *
 * Scenario (Nuvio Sync, not Trakt):
 * 1. User finishes all *aired* episodes of a mid-season show → fully-watched checkmark
 * 2. Next episode is still unaired → may stay on CW as countdown next-up
 * 3. Episode airs same day → old code dropped the series from CW (fully-watched + hasAired)
 * 4. Fix keeps the series and clears the stale checkmark
